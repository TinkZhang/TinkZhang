### 👋 Hi, I’m Tink Zhang
- 👀 I’m a senior mobile App QA and a junior Android developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Android development with Kotlin and Jetpack
- 💞️ I’m creating an Android App [ReadKeeper](https://github.com/TinkZhang/ReadKeeper-Android). This is an App to track your reading progress and remind you to finish a book. 
And I'm trying practice my Android development skill in this project.
